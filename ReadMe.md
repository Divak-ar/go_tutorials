I made this repository public because my friends wanted to learn Go. As a Go enthusiast (or "goblin" as we like to call ourselves), I wanted to share my learning journey with others who are interested in this powerful language.

## Learning Path 

One of the way to learn is to GO by commit history as learning takes time , so you can see progress there but I know convience is what matters to most so

If you're new to Go, I recommend following these tutorials in order:

### 1. Basics 🏗️🏗️
- **tut_1** - Introduction to Go fundamentals: variables, data types, functions, error handling, arrays, slices, maps and loops
- **tut_2** - Object-oriented concepts in Go: structs, interfaces, methods, and pointers
- **tut_3** - More advanced concepts: input handling, working with time, defer statements

### 2. Concurrency ⚡
- **routines** - Go's powerful concurrency model including goroutines, WaitGroups, mutexes, channels, and generics

### 3. Standard Library Modules 📦
- **fs** - File system operations and working with files
- **http** - HTTP client implementation and URL handling

### 4. Web Development 🕸️
- **web/jsonData** - Working with JSON in Go applications
- **web/web_requests** - Making HTTP requests and handling responses
- **web_request** - Advanced API interactions and environment configuration

### 5. Building APIs 🛠️
- **Mods** - Understanding Go modules and dependency management
- **api** - Building a RESTful API with CRUD operations
- **mongo_api** - Complete API with MongoDB integration

### 6. Fun Projects 🕹️
- **pong_game** - Simple Pong game implementation using the Ebiten game engine

## Go's Standard Library 📚

One of Go's biggest strengths is its comprehensive standard library. Throughout these tutorials, you'll see how powerful packages like `net/http`, `io`, `encoding/json`, and others make it easy to build robust applications without heavy dependencies.

## Contributing 🤝

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your own Go learning materials! Whether it's fixing a bug, adding comments, or creating completely new tutorials, all contributions are welcome.
Also , reach out if you learning something new , and building projects with Go .

## Why Go? 💙

Go combines the performance of lower-level languages with the simplicity and productivity of higher-level ones. Its built-in concurrency model (goroutines and channels) makes it perfect for modern, distributed systems. As a goblin who's fallen in love with this language, I hope these tutorials help you appreciate Go's elegance and power!

Happy coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
